	</h1>

	<font size=5 face="cooper black"><p>Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.</p></font>
	<font size=4 face="impact">
	<b>Fact</b>: Mental health problems are actually very common. <br>In 2020, about:
	<ul>
    	<li>One in five Indian adults experiences a mental health issue</li>
    	<li>One in 10 young people experiences a period of major depression</li>
    	<li>One in 25 Indian lives with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression</li>
    </ul>
	</font>
	<font size=5 face="cooper black">
    	<br>Mental illnesses affect 19% of the adult population, 46% of teenagers and 13% of children each year. People struggling with their mental health may be in your family, live next door, teach your children, work in the next cubicle or sit in the same church pew.

		However, only half of those affected receive treatment, often because of the stigma attached to mental health. Untreated, mental illness can contribute to higher medical expenses, poorer performance at school and work, fewer employment opportunities and increased risk of suicide.
